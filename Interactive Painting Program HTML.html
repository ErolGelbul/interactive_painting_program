		Suggested Tasks:
		1. Take time to fully review and become familiar with this template and ensure it works (in the sense that there are no errors).
		2. Fully read the assignment brief - it contains all the requirements and details you need to design, test and implement
		3. After each development cycle (e.g. any time spent programming - this could be an hour to several hours) you are expected to add a changelog entry; each entry should include the date followed by a single sentence that describes what has been changed, updated, added, fixed etc (Please note this is a CORE expectation and requirements, get in to the habit of added them as you go!)
		4. After you have implemented a requirement (there are 11 in total; these are described in sections 2 & 3 of the Marks Awarded section of the assignment brief) conduct and document a test to check whether the implemented requirement works as expected and as needed.  Record these tests in the test log section located and the bottom of this page.
		5. You are not allowed to remove any code already provided but you can expand and further develop it
			5a. Any new functions must abide by the naming convention specified in the assignment brief (e.g. fnPaint should be fnPaint_MW)
			5b. Any new variables must abide by the naming convention specified in the assignment brief (e.g. iMouseX the initial "i" to indicate it will hold an integer value or sColour to indicate a string value)
			5c. Change the name of this template so that YOUR ACTUAL student id replaces the word "studentid" in the filename 
		6. Work to complete the various requirements - start with the simplest, 
			6a. Review and work out how to set the canvas to a more appropriate size (e.g. 800 pixels wide and tall)
			6b.	Extend the functionality implemented in the first colour selector to the other three
			6c. Expand the fnClearCanvas function so that it actually works
			6d. Work out how to enhance the clear canvas function so that it resets the canvas' background colour to the currently selected colour; 
				dont forget to update the important variables (e.g. sCanvasColour)
			6e. Extend the colour selection tools so that there are eight working tools
			6f. Design some method to indicate which colour is active; this should automatically change as soon as a new colour is selected
			6g. This template includes some interested opportunities to explore holding down the control, alt and shift keys while moving the mouse; 
				see if you can somehow use these examples to add implement any of the requirements (e.g. erase mode, brush size, etc.) - remember,
				don't try to solve the whole thing in a single instance, build it up little by little, keep copies of your work so if everything breaks
				you can also return to a working version and try again

		Critical note:
			Please ensure that you maintain and use the expected programming standards outlined in the brief in the Marks Awarded section 4.1 to 4.5 (Programming Standards and Documentation) - especially the use of the REQUIRED function and variable naming convention /

			You will be expected to maintain, program and submit neat code that fully supports appropriate indentation and comments - don't forget failure to maintain standards will result in a significant penalty.  

		Good luck, before we leave you to get on with this - remember, by completing the tutorial sessions and practicalâ€™s all this should (at least) be familiar; complete the tutorials before attempting to program this system.

		Test Log
		*****************************************************************************************
		Test Date, Use & Operatins No (1-6), Description, What did you test, Results, Reflections			
		*****************************************************************************************
		CHANGE THESE BY LOOKING AT THE SLIDES

		29/10/2018, Paint Color Tools (4), Selected Color and Color(1-8), if the identified color is selected onclick on the certain tool, PASSED, simple for now, later on preview feature (of the currently selected color) will be implemented

		29/10/2018, Clear Tool (6), Clearing Canvas, this method will clear wanted object (canvas) in the given rectange therefore clears the canvas entirely, PASSED, simple for now, later on Clear Tool will change the background color to the picked tool

		29/10/2018, Erase Mode (2), Erase (Paint background color), this tool will not "erase" but paint on the canvas with the selected background color, PASSED

		31/10/2018, Brush Sizes (3) and Paint Mode (1), 4 different brush sizes and alligning paint with offsets, created 4 different tools and tried to keep brush sizes in one function however it doesn't work with if statements for each different offset, FAILED, making 4 different functions will not appear practical but will be practical in terms of working out the iOffset

		31/10/2018, Brush Sizes (3) and Paint Mode (1), 4 different brush sizes and alligning paint with offsets, 4 functions have been created and hooked to an individual button so after a button is selected it should change to brush size regarding to the values in the function, PASSES, may appear unorganized this way but is more practical for me to improve if necessary

		1/11/2018, Color Selection (4), Preview Box, a new function has been implemented to display the picked color called "fnDesignatedColor_EG", PASSED, it also displays when the eraser is selected as the white background color which might need an improvement

		1/11/2018, Brush Size (3) and Paint Mode (1), 4 different brush sizes and alligning paint with offsets, tried to keep them in one function but the problem is when this single function is expecting 2 parameters which are width and height it is challanging to change offsets for each different brush size, FAILED, can't find a solution after 6+ hours on brush size doesnt look promising while keeping it in one function

		2/11/2018, Brush Size (3), 4 different brush sizes and alligning paint with offsets as well as highlighting the chosen brush size, PASSED, 4 different functions works perfectly

		2/11/2018, Clear Tool (6), clear tool changes the background color to the selected color and is hooked to the background preview box, PASSED

		3/11/2018, Erase Mode (2), function has been improved to act upon the newly selected background color and erase upon that, PASSED

		3/11/2018, Erase Mode (2) and Paint Mode (1), text will now display which mode is being used by the user, PASSED

		3/11/2018, Blend Tool (5), 3 sliders (rgb) will form a color displayed a unique preview circle for that and users will be able to select this color to paint, PASSED
